# AI collaboration summary

**Student name:** Natalie DeTample

**Assignment:** Week 1 - Markdown fundamentals

## Key interactions

Review your SpecStory history (`.specstory/history/`) and document 3 meaningful interactions with Copilot.

### Interaction 1: Learning how to preview my markdown

**My prompt:**

> how do I preview my about-me.md file

**What I learned:**

I learned the shortcut of ctrl+shift+V opens up a preview of my code. I also learned where to find the button for this and that I can splitscreen my markdown and preview.

**How I applied it:**

I first previewed the code by itself which allowed me to make sure everything was ready for submission. After checking it I tried out the splitscreen which I think will be a very helpful feature for my future projects.

### Interaction 2: Learning what code blocks syntax does

**My prompt:**

> When I type ```markdown is that signaling to me as someone reading the code that the following is in markdown or does the computer read that syntax to know the following is coded in markdown

**What I learned:**

I learned that this syntax is telling the preview that the following text is in markdown so that the preview can properly display it.

**How I applied it:**

I did not use this syntax at all but it made me better understand markdown.

### Interaction 3: Follow up question on block code

**My prompt:**

> what would that example look like if it was ```javascript

**What I learned:**

I solidified my understanding of the code block syntax.

**How I applied it:**

Seeing the example of javascript in color really helped me understand exaclty what the code block syntax does thanks to javascript having more colors.

## Reflection

### Most helpful AI interaction

The preview conversation was most helpful because not only did I get the answer I was looking for, I also got another way to do it that will help me in the future.

### Least helpful AI interaction

There was not a conversation that confused me or was unhelpful.

### What Markdown concepts did you learn?

I specifically learned exactly how the code blocks work in Markdown and how they display the code as the code itself instead of ordinary text.

### Copilot as a learning tool

I was able to use it as a learning tool. Asking it for another example of the code blocks in a different language worked well becasue it seemed to understand what I was looking to see and showed me exactly that.

### Context awareness (optional)

[Did you notice how the `copilot-instructions.md` file affected Copilot's responses? How did knowing about this file change how you think about working with AI?]

## Optional

**Approximate time spent working with AI:** [e.g., 30 minutes, 1 hour]

**Number of conversations in SpecStory history:** [Count the exchanges in your history folder]
